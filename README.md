# Node Social App
A simple social media app made with nodejs and express

# Stack
- NodeJS
- Express
- MySQL
- express-session
- Sequelize

# Why I chose X for stack
- NodeJS: Node makes it very simple to spin up REST API's. Thats about it.
- Express: I can curate the API specifically for my needs while using a lighter server module
- MySQL: Its dead simple to use, and my class used to teach SQL queries and use MySQL
- express-session: This is for development only. I recommend not using this if using this alongside React unless using express for SSR.
- Sequelize: Never used an ORM before, and this seemed like a pretty solid option as it is very mature and has solid documentation
